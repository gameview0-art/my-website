# About This Microsite

This microsite is created for **Assignment 3: Working with Docusaurus** in the TWR2019 course.

The main goals of this site are to:

- Demonstrate that I can set up a Docusaurus project from scratch.
- Create clear, well-structured documentation pages using Markdown.
- Apply basic visual customization to the site (colors, layout, and navigation).
- Deploy the final site to GitHub Pages and manage the source code in GitHub.

## Focus and Audience

This site is designed as a small internal documentation example.  
The intended audience is:

- Instructors reviewing my technical writing work.
- Teammates who might want to understand how a simple Docusaurus microsite is organized.

By completing this assignment, I am practicing both my **technical writing skills** and my **web tooling skills**, which are valuable for real-world documentation projects.
